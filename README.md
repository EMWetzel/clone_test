Cloning from GitHub

1. Visit the repository you want to clone
2. In the "main" for that repository, drop down <> Code
3. Under HTTPS, copy the web URL

4. Open a terminal and cd to where you want the repository cloned

cd C:\Users\...

5. Once you are in the correct folder, type:

git clone <URL>

6. In the terminal cd into the folder that just appeared in your file

cd clone_test

7. Run the clone_test.py

python clone_test.py


#By cloning, if the main branch is updated in GitHub (e.g. I make changes), your local file folder will update
